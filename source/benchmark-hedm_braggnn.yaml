  summary: |
    Uses BraggNN, a deep neural network, for rapid Bragg peak localization in 
    high-energy diffraction microscopy, achieving about 13x speedup compared 
    to Voigt-based methods while maintaining sub-pixel accuracy.

        No dataset links or FAIR metadata; unclear public access
    metrics:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Only localization accuracy and inference time mentioned; not formally benchmarked with scripts
    reference_solution:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        BraggNN model is described and evaluated, but no direct implementation or inference scripts available
    documentation:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Paper is clear, but lacks a GitHub repo or full reproducibility pipeline

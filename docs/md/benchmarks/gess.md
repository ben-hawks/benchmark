**Ratings:**


Software:


  - **Rating:** 3


  - **Reason:** Reference code expected post-conference; current public software availability limited. Benchmark infrastructure partially described but not fully released yet. 


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Benchmark clearly defines OOD robustness scenarios with classification and regression tasks in scientific domains, though no explicit hardware constraints are given. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Curated datasets of 3D crystal structures and material properties are included and publicly available for reproducible research. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Uses well-established metrics such as MAE and structural validity for materials modeling, plus accuracy and OOD robustness deltas. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Two reference models  SODNet, DiffCSP-SC  are reported with results, code expected to be released soon. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Paper and poster provide solid explanation of benchmarks and scientific motivation; more extensive user documentation forthcoming. 


**Average Rating:** 4.333

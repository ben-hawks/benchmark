**Ratings:**


Software:


  - **Rating:** 3


  - **Reason:** Baseline models  SODNet, DiffCSP-SC  are described in the paper; however, fully reproducible code and pretrained models are not publicly available yet. 


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Tasks for regression  Tc prediction  and generative modeling with clear input/output structures and domain constraints are well defined. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Dataset contains 3D crystal structures and associated properties; well-curated but not fully released publicly at this time. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Metrics such as MAE for Tc prediction and validity checks for generated structures are appropriate and clearly described. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Paper provides model architecture details and some training insights, but no complete open-source reference implementations yet. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Paper and GitHub provide good metadata and data processing descriptions; tutorials and user guides could be expanded. 


**Average Rating:** 4.167

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Code and FPGA firmware available on GitHub; integration with hls4ml demonstrated.
        Some deployment details and examples are provided but overall software maturity is moderate.
    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Task clearly defined: real-time single-qubit state classification with latency and
        fidelity constraints. Labeling and ground truth definitions could be more explicit.
    dataset:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Dataset hosted on Zenodo with structured data; however, detailed documentation on
        image acquisition and labeling pipeline is limited.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Standard classification metrics (accuracy, latency) are used and directly relevant
        to the quantum readout task.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 1
      reason: |
        No baseline or starter models with runnable code are linked publicly.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Codabench task page and GitHub repo provide descriptions and usage instructions,
        but detailed API or deployment tutorials are limited.

        abstract =         {The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of leaderboard accuracy tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called the Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from a Kaggle competition. Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning required whatsoever.}

**Ratings:**


Software:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Actively maintained open-source platform  https://paperswithcode.com  under Apache 2.0 license; includes automatic integration with GitHub, datasets, and models for reproducibility. 


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Task and benchmark structures are well organized and standardized, but due to its broad coverage, input/output formats vary significantly between tasks and are not always tightly controlled. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 3


  - **Reason:** Relies on external datasets submitted by the community. While links are available, FAIR compliance is not guaranteed or systematically enforced across all benchmarks. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Tracks state-of-the-art using task-specific metrics like Accuracy, F1, BLEU, etc., with consistent aggregation and historical SOTA tracking. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 3


  - **Reason:** Provides links to implementations of many SOTA models, but no single unified reference baseline is required or maintained per benchmark. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Strong front-end documentation and metadata on benchmarks, tasks, and models; however, some benchmark-specific instructions are sparse or dependent on external paper links. 


**Average Rating:** 4.0

        No instructions available
    specification:
      rating: 1.5
      reason: |
        The platform offers a wide range of material property prediction tasks, but task framing and I/O formats vary by API use and are not always standardized across use cases.
    dataset:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        API key required to access data. No predefined splits.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Uses numerical metrics like MAE and $R^2$
    reference_solution:
      rating: 2
      reason: |
        Numerous models (e.g., Automatminer, CGCNN) trained on the database, but no constraints or documentation listed.

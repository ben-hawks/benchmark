  - real-time inference
  - detector control
  summary: 'Research and Development demonstrator for real-time processing of high-rate tracking data from the sPHENIX detector
    (RHIC) and future EIC systems. Uses GNNs with hls4ml for FPGA-based trigger generation to identify rare events (heavy
    flavor, DIS electrons) within 10 micros latency. Demonstrated improved accuracy and latency on Alveo/FELIX platforms.

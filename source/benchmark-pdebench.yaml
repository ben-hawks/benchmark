  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        GitHub repository (https://github.com/pdebench/PDEBench) is actively maintained and includes
        training pipelines, data loaders, and evaluation scripts. Installation and usage are well-documented.
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Clearly defined tasks for forward and inverse PDE problems, with structured input/output formats,
        system constraints, and task specifications.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Diverse PDE datasets (synthetic and real-world) hosted on DaRUS with DOIs. Datasets are
        well-documented, structured, and follow FAIR practices.
    metrics:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Includes RMSE, boundary RMSE, and Fourier-domain RMSE. These are well-suited to PDE problems,
        though rationale behind metric choices could be expanded in some cases.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Baselines (FNO, U-Net, PINN, etc.) are available and documented, but not every model
        includes full training and evaluation reproducibility out-of-the-box.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Strong documentation on GitHub including examples, configs, and usage instructions.
        Some model-specific details and tutorials could be further expanded.

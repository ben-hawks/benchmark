  fair:

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Open-source GitHub repository available; baseline models and training code partially
        provided but overall framework maturity is moderate.
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Clearly defined tasks including molecule generation, retrieval, and spectrum simulation,
        scoped for MS/MS molecular identification.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Largest public MS/MS dataset with extensive annotations; minor point deducted for
        lack of explicit train/validation/test splits.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Well-defined metrics such as structure accuracy, retrieval precision, and simulation MSE
        used consistently.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 3.5
      reason: |
        CNN-based baselines are referenced, but pretrained weights and comprehensive training
        pipelines are not fully documented.
    documentation:
      rating: 1
      reason: |
        Paper and poster describe benchmark goals and design, but documentation and user
        guides are minimal and repo status uncertain.

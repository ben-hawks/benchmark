  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        While not formally evaluated in the previous version, Zenodo and paper links suggest available code for baseline models
        (e.g., autoencoders, GANs), though they are scattered and not unified in a single repository.
    specification:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        The task and context are clearly described, but system constraints and formal inputs/outputs are not fully specified.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Large-scale dataset hosted on Zenodo, publicly available, well-documented, with defined train/test structure.
        Appears to follow at least 4 FAIR principles.
    metrics:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Uses reasonable metrics (ROC-AUC, detection efficiency) that capture performance but lacks
        full explanation and standard evaluation tools.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 2
      reason: |
        Baselines are described across multiple papers but lack centralized, reproducible implementations
        and hardware/software setup details.
    documentation:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Some description in papers and dataset metadata exists, but lacks a unified guide, README,
        or training setup in a central location.

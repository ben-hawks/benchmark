  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Code is provided in the PRM800K Repo for evaluation and grading, documentation is present but no environment details, baseline model, or training code is given
    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Task is well specified, format, inputs, and outputs are mentioned. No system constraints are provided.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Dataset follows all FAIR Principles. Train/Test splits are available in the PRM800K repo
    metrics:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Correctness is used as the primary metric, with grading guidelines provided.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 2
      reason: |
        A reference solution is mentioned in the "Lets Verify Step by Step" paper, but the model is not open-sourced.
    documentation:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Documentation is present in the PRM800K repo and "Lets Verify Step by Step" paper.

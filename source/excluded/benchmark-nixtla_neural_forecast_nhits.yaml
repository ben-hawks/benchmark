  summary: |
    NHITS (Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series) is a state-of-the-art model that
    improved accuracy by ~25% and reduced compute by 50x compared to Transformer baselines,
    using hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate sampling .

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Implemented within the open-source NeuralForecast library under Apache 2.0.
        Includes training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning pipelines. Actively maintained.
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        The NHITS forecasting task is clearly defined with structured input/output formats.
        Model design targets long-horizon accuracy and compute efficiency.
    dataset:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Uses standard benchmark datasets like M4, but does not bundle them directly.
        FAIR compliance depends on external dataset sources and user setup.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Evaluated using RMSE, MAPE, and other standard forecasting metrics, integrated
        into training and evaluation APIs.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Official NHITS implementation is fully reproducible with training/eval configs,
        though pretrained weights are not always provided.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Well-documented on GitHub and in AAAI paper, with code examples, training guidance,
        and usage tutorials. More model-specific docs could improve clarity further.


# Exclusion Reason: Not a benchmark, baseline/foundation models for time series/neural forcasting

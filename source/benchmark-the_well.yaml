  summary: "A 15 TB collection of ML-ready physics simulation datasets (HDF5), covering 16 domains-from biology to astrophysical\
    \ magnetohydrodynamic simulations-with unified API and metadata. Ideal for training surrogate and foundation models on\
    \ scientific data. \n"

    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: 'The benchmark includes clearly defined surrogate modeling tasks, data structure, and metadata.

        However, constraints and formal task specs vary slightly across domains.

    metrics:
      rating: 3
      reason: 'Domain breadth and dataset size are emphasized. Standardized quantitative metrics for

        model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) are not uniformly applied across all domains.

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Data provided in Github links
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Tasks (energy and force prediction) are clearly defined with explicit I/O specifications, constraints, and physical relevance for renewable energy.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Fully FAIR- OC20, per-adsorbate trajectories, and OC22 are versioned; datasets come with standardized splits, metadata, and are downloadable.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        MAE (energy and force) are standard and reproducible.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Multiple baselines (GemNet-OC, DimeNet++, etc.) implemented and evaluated. No hardware listed.
    documentation:
      rating: 1
      reason: |
        Paper exists, but content is behind a paywall.

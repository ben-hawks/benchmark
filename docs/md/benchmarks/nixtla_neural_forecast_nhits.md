**Ratings:**


Software:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Implemented within the open-source NeuralForecast library under Apache 2.0. Includes training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning pipelines. Actively maintained. 


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** The NHITS forecasting task is clearly defined with structured input/output formats. Model design targets long-horizon accuracy and compute efficiency. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 3


  - **Reason:** Uses standard benchmark datasets like M4, but does not bundle them directly. FAIR compliance depends on external dataset sources and user setup. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 5


  - **Reason:** Evaluated using RMSE, MAPE, and other standard forecasting metrics, integrated into training and evaluation APIs. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Official NHITS implementation is fully reproducible with training/eval configs, though pretrained weights are not always provided. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 4


  - **Reason:** Well-documented on GitHub and in AAAI paper, with code examples, training guidance, and usage tutorials. More model-specific docs could improve clarity further. 


**Average Rating:** 4.333

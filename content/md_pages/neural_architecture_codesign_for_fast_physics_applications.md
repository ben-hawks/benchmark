**Name**: Neural Architecture Codesign for Fast Physics Applications

**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05515

**Domain**: Physics; Materials Science; Particle Physics

**Focus**: Automated neural architecture search and hardware-efficient model codesign for fast physics applications

**Keywords**: neural architecture search, FPGA deployment, quantization, pruning, hls4ml

**Description**: Introduces a two-stage neural architecture codesign  NAC  pipeline combining global and local search, quantization-aware training, and pruning to design efficient models for fast Bragg peak finding and jet classification, synthesized for FPGA deployment with hls4ml. Achieves >30Ã— reduction in BOPs and sub-100 ns inference latency on FPGA. 

**Task Types**: Classification, Peak finding

**AI Capability**: Hardware-aware model optimization; low-latency inference

**Metrics**: Accuracy, Latency, Resource utilization

**Models**: NAC-based BraggNN, NAC-optimized Deep Sets  jet 

**Notes**: Demonstrated two case studies  materials science, HEP ; pipeline and code open-sourced.

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Actively maintained open-source library under Apache 2.0. Offers a clean API,
        extensive model zoo (>30 models), integration with Ray, Optuna, and supports
        scalable training and inference workflows.
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Forecasting task is well-defined with clear input/output structures. Framework supports
        probabilistic and deterministic forecasting, with unified interfaces and support for batch evaluation.
    dataset:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        NeuralForecast does not include its own datasets but supports standard datasets (e.g., M4, M5, ETT).
        FAIR compliance depends on user-supplied data.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        RMSE, MAPE, CRPS, and other domain-relevant metrics are well supported and integrated into the evaluation loop.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Includes runnable model baselines and training scripts for all supported models.
        Some models have pretrained weights, but not all are fully benchmarked out-of-the-box.
    documentation:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Rich documentation with examples, API references, tutorials, notebooks, and CLI support.
        PyPI, GitHub, and official blog posts offer clear guidance for usage and extension.
# Exclusion Reason: Not a benchmark, but a framework that uses external benchmarks/models - should use those as seperate entries instead

  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Reference code expected post-conference; current public software availability limited.
        Benchmark infrastructure partially described but not fully released yet.
    specification:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Benchmark clearly defines OOD robustness scenarios with classification and regression
        tasks in scientific domains, though no explicit hardware constraints are given.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Curated datasets of 3D crystal structures and material properties are included and
        publicly available for reproducible research.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Uses well-established metrics such as MAE and structural validity for materials modeling,
        plus accuracy and OOD robustness deltas.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Two reference models (SODNet, DiffCSP-SC) are reported with results, code expected
        to be released soon.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Paper and poster provide solid explanation of benchmarks and scientific motivation;
        more extensive user documentation forthcoming.

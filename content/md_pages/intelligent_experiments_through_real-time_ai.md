**Name**: Intelligent experiments through real-time AI

**URL**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04845

**Domain**: Instrumentation and Detectors; Nuclear Physics; Particle Physics

**Focus**: Real-time FPGA-based triggering and detector control for sPHENIX and future EIC

**Keywords**: FPGA, Graph Neural Network, hls4ml, real-time inference, detector control

**Description**: Resaerch and Development demonstrator for real-time processing of high-rate tracking data from the sPHENIX detector  RHIC  and future EIC systems. Uses GNNs with hls4ml for FPGA-based trigger generation to identify rare events  heavy flavor, DIS electrons  within 10 µs latency. Demonstrated improved accuracy and latency on Alveo/FELIX platforms. 

**Task Types**: Trigger classification, Detector control, Real-time inference

**AI Capability**: Low-latency GNN inference on FPGA

**Metrics**: Accuracy  charm and beauty detection , Latency  µs , Resource utilization  LUT/FF/BRAM/DSP 

**Models**: Bipartite Graph Network with Set Transformers  BGN-ST , GarNet  edge-classifier 

**Notes**: Achieved ~97.4% accuracy for beauty decay triggers; sub-10 µs latency on Alveo U280; hit-based FPGA design via hls4ml and FlowGNN.

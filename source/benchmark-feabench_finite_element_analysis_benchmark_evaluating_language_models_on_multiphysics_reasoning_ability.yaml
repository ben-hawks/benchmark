  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Code is available, but poorly documented
    specification:
      rating: 1
      reason: |
        Output is defined and task clarity is questionable
    dataset:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Available, but not split into sets
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Fully defined metrics
    reference_solution:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Three open-source models were used. No system constraints.
